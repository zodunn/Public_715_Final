CompSci 715 - Programming for ML Final Project

# Abstract
Developing an efficient solution to the problem of rendering images based on
a 3D scene is a complicated task that many are trying to achieve. Due to the
amount of computation involved in rendering an image it has the potential to
take a long time especially as the demands for higher quality images and faster
response times increase. Addressing this issue will positively impact the graphics
community by providing a way to speed up the rendering pipeline resulting in
faster image generation. This project aims to utilize parallel processing embedded
in the rendering pipeline to increase the speed at which images can render by
enabling the rendering pipeline to calculate the data for multiple objects in a
scene at once.
